**Project Overview**
The goal is to develop an asynchronous task execution and message queuing service that enables applications to handle large volumes of tasks or messages efficiently, improving scalability and reliability. The service should be ideal for managing distributed tasks with built-in retry and error handling, making it suitable for applications that require reliable background processing and integration with block storage like S3 or GCS. It should provide a robust message queuing system that decouples application components, ensuring scalability and fault tolerance. 

**Key Requirements**

1. Task/Message Types:
   - HTTP Requests: Handle tasks that involve making HTTP requests to specified endpoints for triggering webhooks or calling APIs.
   - Background Processing: Manage tasks that require processing in the background, such as data transformation or batch processing. 
   - Text Messages: Handle any text-based messages, including JSON, XML, or plain text.
   - Event Notifications: Manage messages that represent events or triggers for other services or components.
   - Task Queuing: Manage tasks that need to be processed by worker nodes, such as job scheduling or batch processing.

2. Retry Mechanisms & Error Handling:
   - Automatic retry for transient errors like network issues or server unavailability.
   - Configurable retry policies per queue (max attempts, backoff times, max retry duration).
   - Exponential backoff to increase delay between retries.
   - Dead letter queue for permanently failed tasks after exhausting retries.
   - Logging of errors and failures for monitoring and diagnosis.

3. Scalability & Performance:
   - Designed to handle high volume of tasks for applications with significant traffic.
   - Automatic scaling based on number of tasks in queue. 
   - Configurable rate limits per queue to control dispatch rate.
   - Optimized for low-latency task dispatching.
   - Intelligent retry and backoff to maintain performance.

4. Security & Authentication:
   - All data in transit encrypted using TLS/SSL.
   - OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect for authenticating tasks making HTTP requests.
   - Service accounts for authentication when interacting with other cloud services or APIs.

5. Monitoring & Alerting:
   - Metrics tracking (execution rates, queue sizes, latencies).
   - Detailed logging of task execution, errors, retries.
   - Integration with logging and monitoring tools.

6. Deployment & Operations:
   - Deployable on major cloud platforms.
   - Managed service with minimal operational overhead.

**Architecture Overview**

- API layer for submitting tasks/messages and managing queues.
- Queue storage layer for durably persisting tasks/messages.
- Worker fleet for executing tasks asynchronously.
- Scheduler for orchestrating task execution based on policies.
- Retry handling and dead letter queues.
- Monitoring and logging components.

**Testing Plan**

1. Unit Testing: 
   - Comprehensive unit test coverage for all core components.
   - Mocking of dependencies like storage services.
   - Aim for >80% code coverage.

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test end-to-end flows with real queues and worker nodes.
   - Verify correct behavior with different task/message types.
   - Test error scenarios and retry handling.

3. Load & Performance Testing:
   - Simulate high-volume workloads.
   - Measure latencies, throughput, resource utilization.
   - Verify auto-scaling under load.
   - Identify bottlenecks and optimize.

4. Security Testing:
   - Penetration testing and vulnerability scans.
   - Verify authentication and authorization mechanisms.
   - Test encryption of data in transit and at rest.

5. Chaos Testing:
   - Introduce failures in the system (network issues, node failures).
   - Verify graceful handling and recovery.
   - Ensure no data loss or inconsistencies.
