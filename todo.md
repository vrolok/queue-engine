# TODO.md

This file serves as a comprehensive checklist to build the asynchronous task execution and message queuing service. Each section represents an iterative phase of the project with detailed tasks. Check each item off as you complete it.

---

## 1. Project Setup & Foundation

- [x] **Repository Structure**
  - [x] Create the project repository.
  - [x] Initialize a README.md describing the project purpose.
  - [x] Create a configuration file (e.g., `config.yaml` or `config.json`) with placeholders for queue policies, security settings, etc.
  - [x] Create the following directory structure:
    - `/src`
      - `/api` — API layer code.
      - `/queue` — Queue management and task data models.
      - `/worker` — Worker logic for task processing.
      - `/scheduler` — Scheduler and rate-limiting code.
      - `/logging` — Logging and monitoring utilities.
      - `/security` — Security and authentication utilities.
    - `/tests` — Unit and integration tests.
  - [x] Create `main.py` in `/src` to serve as the application entry point.
  - [x] Add a startup log message in `main.py` and load configuration.

---

## 2. API Layer Implementation

- [x] **API Setup**
  - [x] Choose a lightweight framework (Flask or FastAPI).
  - [x] Set up the basic scaffolding of the API in `/src/api`.
  
- [x] **Task Submission Endpoint**
  - [x] Implement an endpoint (e.g., POST `/tasks`) that accepts JSON payloads.
  - [x] Ensure the payload includes:
    - `task_type` (e.g., HTTP Request, Background Processing)
    - `payload` (data necessary for task execution)
    - (Optional) Retry policy parameters
  - [x] Validate incoming JSON data and handle errors gracefully.
  - [ ] Wire the API to pass tasks to the queue module.

- [x] **Integration**
  - [x] Import and integrate the API within `main.py` so the web server starts correctly.

---

## 3. Queue Module & Data Handling

- [x] **Define the Task Model**
  - [x] In `/src/queue`, create a Task data model with:
    - `task_id`
    - `task_type`
    - `payload`
    - `retry_count`
    - `status`
    - Timestamps (e.g., submitted, processed)
  
- [x] **Queue Operations**
  - [x] Implement functions to enqueue tasks.
  - [x] Implement functions to dequeue tasks.
  - [x] Start with an in-memory queue or simple database abstraction.
  - [x] Add basic error handling in the enqueue and dequeue operations.

- [x] **Integration**
  - [x] Ensure the API endpoint from step 2 stores tasks using the queue module.

---

## 4. Worker Module for Task Processing

- [x] **Basic Worker Setup**
  - [x] In `/src/worker`, create a module that continuously polls the queue.
  - [x] Design a task dispatching mechanism that selects the handler based on `task_type`.
  
- [x] **Task Handlers**
  - [x] Create a stub function to simulate HTTP requests for HTTP Request tasks.
  - [x] Create stub functions for other task types (e.g., background processing).
  
- [x] **Logging**
  - [x] Log outcomes for each task (success, failure, or retry needed).

- [x] **Integration**
  - [x] Wire the worker module to be startable from `main.py` for asynchronous processing.

---

## 5. Scheduler & Rate Limiting

- [x] **Scheduler Implementation**
  - [x] Create a scheduler in `/src/scheduler` that dispatches tasks from the queue.
  - [x] Configure the scheduler to work at a defined rate from `config.yaml`.
  
- [x] **Rate Limiting & Auto-scaling**
  - [x] Implement rate limiting controls (max tasks per unit time).
  - [x] Simulate auto-scaling by controlling how many tasks are processed concurrently.
  - [x] Ensure low-latency dispatching without overloading workers.

- [x] **Integration**
  - [x] Integrate scheduler logic with the worker module.

---

## 6. Retry Logic & Exponential Backoff

- [x] **Retry Mechanism**
  - [x] Enhance the worker module to identify transient errors (e.g., network issues).
  - [x] Add retry logic that checks the number of retry attempts for each task.
  - [x] Configure retry policies: maximum attempts, minimum and maximum backoff times, and maximum retry duration.
  
- [x] **Exponential Backoff**
  - [x] Implement exponential backoff to increase delay between successive retries.
  - [x] Log every retry attempt with current delay and count.

- [ ] **Integration**
  - [ ] Move permanently failed tasks to the dead letter queue (see next section) after exhausting retries.

---

## 7. Dead Letter Queue

- [ ] **Dead Letter Queue Setup**
  - [ ] Extend the queue module in `/src/task_queue` to support a dead letter queue.
  - [ ] Create functions to move tasks from the main queue to the dead letter queue after exceeding retry limits.
  
- [ ] **Logging**
  - [ ] Log details of tasks moved into the dead letter queue for further analysis.
  
- [ ] **Integration**
  - [ ] Ensure the worker module calls this functionality when tasks permanently fail.

---

## 8. Logging & Monitoring

- [ ] **Logging Module**
  - [ ] Create standardized logging utilities in `/src/logging`.
  - [ ] Ensure logging captures:
    - Task submission events
    - Task execution outcomes (success, error, retry)
    - Key metrics (execution rates, queue sizes, latencies)
  
- [ ] **Monitoring Integration**
  - [ ] Format logs for integration with external monitoring tools (e.g., ELK).
  - [ ] Add hooks to expose or visualize metrics if necessary.

- [ ] **Integration**
  - [ ] Integrate logging into all modules: API, queue, worker, scheduler, and retry logic.

---

## 9. Security & Authentication

- [ ] **TLS/SSL for API**
  - [ ] Ensure all API endpoints are served over TLS/SSL.
  - [ ] Set up or simulate certificate handling.

- [ ] **Authentication for HTTP Tasks**
  - [ ] Implement OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect for tasks making HTTP requests.
  
- [ ] **Service Accounts**
  - [ ] Provide utilities for service account authentication for interactions with external APIs or cloud services.
  
- [ ] **Integration**
  - [ ] Wire authentication mechanisms into the API endpoints and task handlers.

---

## 10. Integration, Testing & Final Wiring

- [ ] **Module Integration**
  - [ ] Wire all modules (API, queue, worker, scheduler, logging, security) in `main.py`.
  - [ ] Validate that tasks submitted via the API are:
    - Enqueued correctly.
    - Processed by the worker with proper retry and backoff.
    - Redirected to the dead letter queue upon permanent failure.
  
- [ ] **Testing Plan Implementation**
  - [ ] Write unit tests for each module ensuring >80% code coverage.
  - [ ] Create integration tests to simulate end-to-end flows.
  - [ ] Setup load and performance tests to verify scalability and low-latency.
  - [ ] Conduct security testing (TLS/SSL configuration, authentication checks).
  - [ ] Prepare chaos tests (simulate network and processing failures) to ensure robustness.

- [ ] **Final Integration Check**
  - [ ] Confirm that all prompts have been implemented.
  - [ ] Perform a code review to ensure no orphaned code exists.
  - [ ] Generate a report of metrics and logs to validate operations.

## 11. Final Verification & Deployment

- [ ] **Review and Final Testing**
  - [ ] Perform final system testing to ensure all modules interact as expected.
  - [ ] Validate that monitoring, logging, and security measures are in place.
  
- [ ] **Documentation Update**
  - [ ] Update README.md with deployment instructions.
  - [ ] Document configuration options and API endpoints.

- [ ] **Deployment**
  - [ ] Prepare deployment scripts/configurations.
  - [ ] Deploy the system in a test environment first.
  - [ ] Monitor performance and prepare for production rollout.
